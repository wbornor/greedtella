# greedtella  
An Open Source Greedy Gnutella Client. Efficient because it only cares about itself.

In the beginning Limewire was great; small, lightweight, fast. Then it became bloated with features like the embedded audio player, chat functionality, etc... Also since it runs in the JRE it has a large memory footprint.

I wanted something that was fast, small, and does only one thing, downloads files from other GNUtella servents. Since the protocol is open, its easy to see how to manipulate it so that it only fulfills the cliENT side of the servENT model.

I wanted a command prompt user interface as one of the interfaces so that I could SSH into one machine, fire up Greedtella and download a file from any computer on the net.
