Yeah, Greedtella is all about open source, anybody is welcome to work on it.

Let me tell you a little about it...
I have been using limewire for about 3 years now, and in the beginning it 
was great; small, lightweight, fast. Recently its been getting bloated with 
features like the embedded audio player, chat functionality, etc... Also 
since it runs in the JRE it has a large memory footprint.

I wanted something that was fast, small, and does only one thing, downloads 
files from other GNUtella servents. Since the protocol is open, its easy 
to see how to manipulate it so that it only fulfills the cliENT side of 
the servENT model.

When I started Greedtella I was reading about eXtreme programming, and I 
really like the modularity and unit testing code structure. So I structured 
Greedtella on that model. My goal was to write a functional library that 
was extremly modular so that any type of user interface could be written atop 
of it.

I really wanted a command prompt user interface as one of the interfaces 
so that I could SSH into one machine, fire up Greedtella, download a song, 
from any computer on the net.

In the near future of Greedtella, it needs to be updated to the new GNUtella 
protocol (0.6). There are many interesting parts to this new protocol which 
really reduce network traffic, including host caching, and Ultrapeer. I 
haven't read over the whole spec, but there shouldn't be too many additions 
to the current Greedtella code.
